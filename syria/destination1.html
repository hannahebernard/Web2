					<p class= "subtitle">You move to an area that has a high density of other internally displaced people.</p>
					<p class= "locationtext">This seems hopeful at first, until you realize that you have become the target of your own government. Since 2011, most all IDP displacement locations have been targeted or hit by regime violence and air strikes. Duoma, a neighborhood in Damascus,for instance, became a hot spot that was targeted as a result of the presence of IDPs and protesters. And in 2014, 40 percent of IDPs in need of shelter and assistance were living in the Alepo governorate which has since been hard hit by the conflict. </p>
