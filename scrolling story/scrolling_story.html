This scrolling story is a point of view journey through the eyes of one of Syriaâ€™s millions of internally displaced persons. </p>

<p>IDPs are individuals that are forced to leave their homes and are not being protected by their own government, but who are unable to leave their country because of war zones or resources and have become stuck inside their dangerous borders unable to seek asylum. </p>

<p>Due to the current multifaceted conflict, Syria is now responsible for the world's largest number of IDPs: 7.6 million (estimated by Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA) Experts describe the day-to-day existence of these internal refuges as being like a hidden purgatory. </p>
<p>
This is a virtual walk through designed to put users in the life of an IDP trying to escape in an attempt to evoke empathy and understanding. </p>


<p>The user will be given a role and asked to make touch choices along their journey.
</p>
<p>How would you find safety? What would you do if you had nowhere to turn?  </p>
