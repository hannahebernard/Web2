	<h1 class="title1">Protests and Civil Uprising (January–July 2011)</h1>

	<p class="para1">The protests started on 15 March 2011, when protesters marched in the capital of Damascus, demanding democratic reforms and the release of political prisoners.The security forces retaliated by opening fire on the protesters,and according to witnesses who spoke to the BBC, the government forces detained six of them.The protest was triggered by the arrest of a boy and his friends by the government for writing the graffiti, "The people want the fall of the regime", in the city of Daraa. Louai al-Hussein, an analyst and writer wrote that "Syria is now on the map of countries in the region with an uprising". On the 20th, the protesters burned down a Ba'ath Party headquarters. The ensuing clashes claimed the lives of seven police officers and 15 protesters. Ten days later in a speech, President Bashar al-Assad blamed "foreign conspirators" pushing Israeli propaganda for the protests.

		<h1 class="title3">Escalation (November 2011 – March 2012)</h1>

	<p class="para3">In early November, clashes between the FSA and security forces in Homs escalated as the siege continued. After six days of bombardment, the Syrian Army stormed the city on November 8th, leading to heavy street fighting in several neighborhoods. Resistance in Homs was significantly greater than that seen in other towns and cities, and some in opposition have referred to the city as the "Capital of the Revolution". Unlike events in Deraa and Hama, operations in Homs have thus far failed to quell the unrest.
